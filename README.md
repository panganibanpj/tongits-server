Counting Card Values
====================

The purpose of this project is to test out algorithms for an online card game I've been working on. The game is called [tong-its](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tong-its). Each card has a number value - aces are 1, faces are 10. The goal is to count the total as quick as possible. Here are the rules:

- The most number of cards to have to count are 13
- At least 3 cards in a row of the same suit **do not count** (Aces are low). I'm calling these "runs"
- Neither do "sets" of at least 3 value cards e.g. 3 Aces


Sidenote: I haven't figued out how to rename this project lol

Sidenote 2: I plan on hosting the entire project here or some other platform, but wanted to continue working on this algorithm before having to figure out how to hook my project up
